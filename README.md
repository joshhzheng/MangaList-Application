# CPSC210 Personal Project

## MyMangaList

### Functionality:
- Takes two inputs (String, Int)
- First String is Name of Manga
- Second String is Rating of Manga
- Stores a list of these data types

### What Will The Application Do?
This application will help keep track of the mangas you read. You will be able to view the mangas in order of the time you added
them into the list. 

### Who Will Use It? Why Is This Project of Interest to You?
This app is primarily targeted towards avid readers who are interested in keeping track of what books/mangas they have read.
